<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Parsis Official Translation Center</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Considering the growing need of students, businessmen, international companies, business owners, university professors, and international cultural centers to translation services of rare and not-well-known languages and the lack of an all-encompassing center for the provision of these services in Iran, Parsis Official Translation Center started its activities in 2005 under the management and supervision of Mr. Abdul Zahra Ghobeyshavi.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Parsis Official Translation Center currently provides high-quality and expert oral and written translation services for over 160 languages ​​and dialects.</p>
